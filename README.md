# SyntaxParser

**SyntaxParser** is a modular and lightweight C++ library designed for use with Arduino (and other embedded systems) to build syntax-aware parsers and interpreters.

It provides:
- A templated `Node<T>` implementation
- Linked-listâ€“based Trie structures (`ChildList`)
- Functional callbacks for syntax matching
- Unit-testable core components using Catch2 (desktop only)
